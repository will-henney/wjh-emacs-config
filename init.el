;;; .emacs --- Will Henney's GNU Emacs configuration
;; 

;;; Commentary:
;; 
;;  Will Henney's personal configuration file for Emacs (not XEmacs)
;;  This file just sets up some paths and file names. All the
;;  functionality is bundled into sub-files.

;;; History:
;; 
;;  WJH 04 May 2005 :: ran it through checkdoc (do I really want that
;;                     `provide' at the end?)
;;  WJH 03 May 2005 :: added customize section
;;  WJH 01 May 2005 :: initial version

;;; Code:
(defvar wjh-local-lisp-dir (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
  "*Where I keep all my elisp files.")
(add-to-list 'load-path wjh-local-lisp-dir)

;; Put customize modifications in a separate file a la xemacs
(cond
 ((boundp 'aquamacs-version)

  ;;; do not exist in Emacs.app and vice versa
  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/custom.el"))
;;   (setq custom-file (concat wjh-local-lisp-dir "/custom-empty.el"))
